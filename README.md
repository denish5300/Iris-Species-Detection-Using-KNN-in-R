# Iris-Species-Detection-Using-KNN-in-R

Knn algorithm was applied on the training set to detect Iris species of the test dataset.

Data set has 4 features including spedal length in cm, spedal width in cm, petal length in cm, petal width in cm and 1 target feature which is the feature that we wanted to predict here using k-NN algorithm. The target feature consist of 3 classes where each class refers to a type of Iris plant: setosa, versicolor, virginica.

The train data set has 105 onservations, 5 variables. The test data set has 45 observations, 4 variables.
